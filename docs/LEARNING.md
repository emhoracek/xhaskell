## Learning Haskell 

Haskell is a purely functional language, which is a paradigm fundamentally different than the more commonly taught [object oriented approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). Because of this, learning Haskell can feel different than simply picking up another language.

### Courses

The University of Pennsylvania's [CIS 194 course](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html) has lecture notes and exercises available for free online. It's best if you're already familiar with another programming language.

### Books

Chris Allen and Julie Moronuki's [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/) aims to be a comprehensive guide to Haskell for people new to programming.

[Maybe Haskell](https://gumroad.com/l/maybe-haskell/) is a great introduction to Haskell through the "Maybe" type, especially for Ruby programmers.

[Learn You a Haskell For Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) teaches Haskell through examples. Good if you already know how to program but are new to functional programming. *Free online*!

### Other resources

The Haskell
[wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learning_Haskell#Online_tutorials) has an abundance of resources on beginning.
